# Homelab

## Intro

This is the first of a multi-post series detailing my adventure in Kubernetes.  I will go over what hardware i selected, what Kubernetes deployment method i chose, my first deployments, converting my docker compose manifests into Kubernetes manifests, storage, backups, GitOps with ArgoCD, and much more.  

This is my first time diving into Kubernetes, and the learning curve was high.  But i've learned a lot and i hope that by documenting what i went through, it'll help you on your journey to better understanding Kubernetes.
